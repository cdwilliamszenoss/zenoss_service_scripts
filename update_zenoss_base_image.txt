Instructions on Updating Base Image

Note:
  You can use use the ImageName and TAG or ImageID number

- List resmgr docker images 
 docker images | awk -F '-' '/resmgr/ {print $1,$2}' |sort -r -n -k 2

- Examine the image layers for a selected image (look for images newest CREATED Timestamp):
 docker history <imageID>

- Create Backup of Base Image:
 docker save -o resmgr_6.2.tar  50cae9ef82ea

- Start the container and modify Base Image for resmgr_5.3. Install packages on image and save changes
 docker run -it --name network_utils 50cae9ef82ea
 yum install epel-release
 yum install fping mtr
 yum clean all
 exit

- Show  exited container to retrieve the containter ID and commit changes to layer
 docker ps -f status="exited"
 docker commit de88790aa5d0  zenoss/resmgr_6.2:network_utils

- Save new image to tar file
 docker save -o resmgr_6.2.network_utils.tar zenoss/resmgr_6.2:network_utils

- If the serviced service is not running, start the service. 
 systemctl start serviced

- Override the current image
 serviced docker override  zenoss/resmgr_6.2:latest zenoss/resmgr_6.2:network_utils

- Asynchronously push all images from the serviced Docker registry index into the Docker registry:
 serviced docker sync

- Perform a staged shutdown of the Zenoss.

- Stop serviced and docker services on all servers in the Zenoss infrastructure. 

- Finally, start-up services and the utilities will be available in the containers that use the resmgr base image.
